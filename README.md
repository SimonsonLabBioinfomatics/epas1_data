#### Functional *EPAS1*/*HIF2A* missense variant is associated with hematocrit in Andean highlanders

Abstract

Hypoxia inducible factor pathway genes are linked to adaptation in both human and non-human highland species. EPAS1, a notable target of hypoxia adaptation, is associated with relatively lower hemoglobin concentration in Tibetan highlanders. We provide evidence for an association between an adaptive EPAS1 variant (rs570553380, A>G p.[His194Arg]) and the same phenotype of relatively low hematocrit in Andean highlanders. This Andean-specific missense variant is present at a modest frequency in Andeans and absent in other human populations and vertebrate species except the coelacanth, a lobe-finned fish. CRISPR-base-edited human cells with this variant exhibit functional shifts in hypoxia-regulated gene expression, while metabolomic analyses reveal both genotype and phenotype associations and validation in a lowland population. Although this genocopy of relatively lower hematocrit in Andean highlanders parallels well-replicated findings in Tibetans, it likely involves distinct pathway responses based on a protein-coding versus non-coding variants, respectively. Together, these findings illuminate how unique variants at EPAS1 contribute to the same phenotype in Tibetans and a subset of Andean highlanders despite distinct evolutionary trajectories.
